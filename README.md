Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub Playground! ðŸŽ‰

I'm Logan, a passionate explorer of the digital realm, constantly tinkering with code, creating music, and diving into the depths of artificial intelligence. Here's a glimpse into what makes me tick:

Tinkering with Code
I love working with Python, JavaScript, Machine Learning, and Web Development. Let's build something awesome together!

Music Production
In my musical universe, you'll find Electronic, Hip-hop, and Ambient vibes. I play around with instruments like FL studio, my keyboard, and a behringer MS-1 synth.

AI Enthusiast
Greetings! I'm an AI enthusiast, fascinated by Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. Let's train some models and make the world smarter!

Let's Connect!
Feel free to reach out if you're into any of these realms too or just want to chat. Collaboration, brainstorming, or jamming sessions â€” I'm up for anything!
